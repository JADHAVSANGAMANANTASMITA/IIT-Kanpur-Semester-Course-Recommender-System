Request for Summer Internship

Respected Sir,  

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Sangam Anant Jadhav, and I am currently pursuing my M.Tech in Industrial and Management Engineering under the Department of Management Sciences. My roll number is 231140021, and I have a current CPI of 8.9.  

I am eager to pursue an internship at Energy Analytics Lab, IIT Kanpur during the upcoming summer break, as I believe this experience will greatly benefit academic and professional growth.

I have proficient knowledge in Python and Machine Learning, Deep Learning (ongoing) and hands-on experience in geoinformatics (including Remote Sensing, GIS, satellite image processing) can be valuable to the ongoing projects at the Energy Analytics Lab, IIT Kanpur.

Previously, I completed an internship as a Data Scientist at Hertzsoft Technologies Private Limited, Mumbai (2 months) during the last summer break. Additionally, I have approximately one and a half years of experience as a Lecturer Trainee and Lecturer before starting my M.Tech. 

Due to health reasons, I had to deregister from Semester 3 (2024-25) after undergoing surgery for appendicitis, resulting in an extension of my M.Tech program until December 2025.

I learned about this internship opportunity through my classmate and your thesis student Aman Ingle (MT/IME/2023). As I will be on campus during the summer break, I would like to discuss this internship further and explore how I can contribute to your ongoing research work.

I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you at your convenience to discuss this internship further. 
I have attached my resume for your reference.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of working with you.  

Best regards,  
Sangam Jadhav
